# Taiga

Taiga is an open source, lightweight, anime tracker for Windows. It can automatically detect the episodes you're watching on your computer and synchronize your progress with online services such as [Hummingbird](http://hummingbird.me) and [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net). It helps you manage your list, discover new series, share watched episodes and download new ones.
